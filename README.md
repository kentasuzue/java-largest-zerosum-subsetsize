# java-largest-zerosum-subsetsize
This program is in Java.  The program reads a text file, in.txt, that contains a list of positive and negative integers (duplicate are possible, but zero is not) separated by spaces and/or line breaks. After reading the integers, the program saves them in a singly linked list in the same order in which they appear in the input file. Then, without changing the linked list, the program prints out the size of the largest zero-sum subset of integers. A zero-sum subset is a subset of integers whose sum is zero. If the list does not contain a subset of integers whose sum is zero, the program prints out zero. It is assumed that in.txt is in the same folder as the java files and that it contains at least one integer.
